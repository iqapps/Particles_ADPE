# Particles_ADPE

ADPE is a IDE for Android, that uses Java like syntax programming languate with a framework for creating UI graphics, and functions to generate installable Android applications.

This program requires ADPE to compile and run.

GIT support within ADPE is rather simple and not easy to use with GIT or Github, why I installed a secondary application just to sync the development folder with GIT or Github.

This was my take on testing ADPE, and my conclusion is ðŸ‘Ž but...

If this was under development or was passed on as open source on Github, I would give it thums up. Unfortunately this seems to be stuck as no updates are coming.

The language is - a language, its java with an OK framework behind it. It works.

The IDE is also OK, not exceptionel, but it works. You can write something like this sample on a phone. Debugging is non existing.

The compiler can generate a preview and run it, or generate an app, a watchface, a wallpaper, or VR ?

Documentation for the language is too complicated to get at, open menu, click to show reference, find groupd, then find keyword, etc. etc. Much too complicated.
